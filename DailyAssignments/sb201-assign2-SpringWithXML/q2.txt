Bean life cycle:
----------------
Bean lifecycle has 5 stages:
1. Does not exist phase:
-In this phase our bean does not exist
2. Instantiation phase:
-In this phase the container loades the spring bean class into the memory, It 
creates the spring bean object & resolves its dependencies.
3. Initialisation phase:
-In this phase the initialisation method(init-method) is called by the 
container.
4. Service phase:
-In this phase the container provides the bean object refrence to the user, the
user can call the business methods.
5. Destroy phase:
In this phase the container calls the destroy method(destroy-method) before the
container is shutdown.

Now all the beans are eligible for garbage collection.
