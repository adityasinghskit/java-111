Transient Keyword:
------------------

Let's say we want to serialize a Student object which has the following fields-

1. String email;
2. String password;

But password being sensitive we want to ignore the password in serialization
so we can add transient keyword when declaring password-

transient String password;

Orignal value of Password now will be ignored during serialization. 
During deserialization default value of Password field will be displayed.
