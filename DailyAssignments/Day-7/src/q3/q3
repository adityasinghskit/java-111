	Two main uses of this keyword:
	1. To avoid confusion between keywords
	E.g.
	public class Student{
	int id;
	String name;
	double salary;
	
	void setId(int id){
		this.id=id;
	}
	public void main(String args[]){
		Student s1=new Student();
		
	}

	}
	here we have use variable name as id and also 
	argument as id so to avoid confusion writing
	 id=id;  we use this.
	2. When using objects we use this to update variables for 
	that object
	In the above Example to update the instance var of s1
	 we use this keyword.
	
	Super keyword:
	When we create an object using method, super() is 
	implemented by default.
	Super created an object of the parent class hence 
	loading all non static elements. 
	This process goes on till the object of Object class
	is created.
	hence loading all the non static methods and variables 
	available to a class.
