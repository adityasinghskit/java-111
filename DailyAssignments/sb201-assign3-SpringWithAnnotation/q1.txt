Annotations:
-------------
1. @Service:
-It is a stereotype annotation, it deines the role of a class as a service 
level class.
2. @Component:
-It is also a stereotype annotation , this is used when we are not sure about 
the role of the class.
3. @Autowired:
-It is applies before a variable, setter mathod, constructor.
-It automatically gives setter to the variable so need to write a setter
-It is used only with user defined variable.
-It searches first byName than byType.
E.g.
	@Service
	public class A {
	@Autowired
	private B b1;
	public void funA() {
	System.out.println("inside funA of A");
	System.out.println(b1);
	}
	}
4. @ComponentScan:
-Using ComponentScan the container searches a base package and all its 
subpackages for classes with stereotype annotation and registers tham as 
spring bean.
5. @Bean:
-This annotation is used to register a class as a spring bean.
-It is used in the configApp class before the method that returns the
 class that we want to register.
E.g.
	@Configuration
	@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.masai")
	public class AppConfig {
	@Bean
	public B getB(){
	B b1=new B();
	return b1;
	}
6. @Value:
-This annotation is used to enter values in the primitive variables.
E.g.
@Value("100")
int roll=100;
@Value("Ram")
String name;
-This can also be done through a .properties file.
