Difference between Static and dynamic webapges:
-----------------------------------------------
1. In Static webages content is fixed for all users, it is precreated(before client
 request).Eg Wikipedia, mdn, w3schools. Whereas in dyanmic webpages content will 
change dynamically based on the input given by user.Eg fb,youtube, twitter.

2. Webresources that generate static webpages are called static webresource program
.Eg. html. Whereas webresource that can generate dynamic webresource program. Eg.
Servlet program and jsp program.

Note: Web application is a combination of static resource(html,css,image,mp3) and 
dynamic resource(servlet and jsp).
