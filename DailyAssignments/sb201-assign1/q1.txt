Tight coupling:
---------------
Let there are two classes A & B, A is dependent upon B ie. B is dependency.
E.g.
class B{

funB(){
syso();
}
}

class A{
B b1;

funA(){
b1.funB();

}

} 

Here if there is a change in class B the same should be reflected in class A
, this is called tight coulping.

Loose Coupling:
----------------
-Loose coupling is when changes in dependencies need not be reflected in 
the dependent class.
-To apply loose coupling we need to follow rules:
1. Dependency classes should follow POJO/POJI model.
2. Apply dependency injection method.

Eg. See q3.
