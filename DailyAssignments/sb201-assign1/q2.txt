Spring IOC(Inversion of Control):
------------
- Normally in the dependent-dependency realtionship classes, the object of 
dependency is created by the dependent class, and its methods are called.
-  But in IOC an external entity takes care of creation of object of 
dependency.
-In Spring the spring IOC container pushes dependency object in dependency 
classes.
