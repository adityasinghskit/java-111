Dynamic Polymorphism
Also known  as runtime polymorphism, See the example: 

public class A{
void methodA(){
System.out.println("Inside methodA of class A");
}
}
class B extends A{
@Override
void methodA(){
System.out.println("Inside methodA of class B");
}
}
public static void main(String args[]){
	A a1= new B();
	a1.methodA();
}

At runtime it will be decided if methodA  is overridden by classB, 
If it is then the Overridden methodA will be called.
This process of deciding at runtime is called "runtime polymorphism"
