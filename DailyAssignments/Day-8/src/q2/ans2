Class cast exception:-
Class cast exception occurs when you try to caste a class 
into a class which is not compatible :
 E.g.
 class A{...}
 class B extends A{...}
 class C extends A{...}
 
 1. You can caste any of the objects to Object since all
 	classes inherit from Object class.
 2. Objects from B & C can be casted to A since A is 
 	parent class of B & C.
 3. An object of B but referenced to A can be casted to 
 	B since it's object of B.
 4. Up casting B or C to A is not possible just like in 
 	primitive variables.
 5. B cannot be casted to C or vice-versa.
