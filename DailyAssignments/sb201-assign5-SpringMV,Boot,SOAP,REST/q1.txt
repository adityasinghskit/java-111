MVC architecture:
-----------------

-Web appliation(WA) consists of static and dynamic componets, and the data access
logic, business logic, and presentation logic are together and interdependent, there
is no clear separation of logic.

Using Servlet and jsp:
----------------------
http request:
-------------

- The client request is captured by Servlet implementation class which also 
validates the data.
- It then transfers the data to the service layer which processes the data.
- The data is then transfered to data access layer which persists the data in the
database.  

http response:
---------------

-The data is fetched from the database, into the DAL layer, into SL .
-After getting responce from SL jsp will generate a dynamic html.

After MVC:
----------

-If we want to generate a WA using MVC architecture manually, than we have to 
develop servlet class, jsp class and write the flow control logic manually.
-But using spring-web-mvc module it provides a predefined servlet class with 
predefined flow control logic ie. Dispatcher Servlet class.
