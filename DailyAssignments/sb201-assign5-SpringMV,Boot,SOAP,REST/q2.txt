Difference between SOAP and REST api:
--------------------------------------

SOAP api(Simple Object Access Protocol):

- It uses an xml based protocal to communicate between client and server application.
Due to which it is platform independent.
- WSDL file is also an xml file describes the services which we give to the clients.
-SOAP based WS is a heavy weight application because along with the main classes 
we also have to create some binding classes to parse the xml and create java 
objects. Creating WSDL file is also a complex task.

REST api(Represantational State Transfer):
------------------------------------------

- To make the WS creation as light as possible REST architecture was developed.
- In REST architecture we craete a WS with required classes but expose them using 
http protocol, Client can access them using http protocol without the use of extra
 binding classes and xml files.
-Based in the architecture sun microsystem came out with JAX-RS api to create 
REStful webservices.
-In REST WS, the root class is called the "root resource" class and each method is
called each method of that  is called a "resource".
