Multiple inheritance in java
Java does not allow multiple inheritance in classes.
In case a child class is inheriting 2 classes and 
both the parent classes have a method with same name
than this creates ambiguity for the compiler to call
which method.
For example:
//Parent class1
class A{
public void meth1(){

}
}
//Parent class2
class B{
public void meth1(){
}
}
//Child class
class C extends A{

}
class C extends B{

}
C c1= new C();
C.meth1(); //Ambigious since compilor is confused 
		   //which meth1 to call.
