Q1.
1. String is immutable so as to save memory.
   E.g. String str1= "Hello";
	String str2= "Hello";
	In this case since both str1, str2 refer to the same 
	text only one String will be created and both str1, str2
	will point to the same String hence saving memory.

2. String: 
   String is immutable hence no chnages can be done after a String
   is formed.
   E.g. String str1= "Welcome";
	str1 + "to Masai!";
	No changes will be reflected in str1. In order to save the
	changes a new String has to created each time.
	String str2= str1 + "to Masai!";
   String builder:
   String builder can solve this problem, It is used when we want 
   an mutable String. Using string builder we can perform above 
   operation using one SB.
   E.g. StringBuilder str1= new StringBuilder("Welcome");
	str1=str1 + "to Masai!";
	
3. String opertions
    Concat: It is use to concat two string.
	E.g. Str1.concat(Str2);
